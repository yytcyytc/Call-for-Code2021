## Background
After our team has identified the subject of climate change, the first thing that comes to our mind is the "double carbon issue", which everyone has been paying attention to in the past two years, namely "carbon peaking" and "carbon neutrality".
"Carbon peak" refers to the peak of carbon dioxide emissions at a certain moment, and gradually declines afterly. "Carbon neutral" refers to offset self-generated carbon emissionsthe by the use of plant afforestation、energy saving and emission reduction, which in order to achieve the relatively zero emissions.
